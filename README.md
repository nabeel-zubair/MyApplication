#Boilerplate for React Native and TypeScript

Greetings!

This is a boilerplate created using the React Native CLI and Typescript.

Some common functionalities that developers usually require are bundled with the package already.
The bundle includes:

- Redux Saga middleware
- Flipper debugger (mostly for Redux DevTools)
- React Native Paper UI Library
- React Navigation (Basic implementation of the Stack Navigator)

Feel free to add your components and get going with your projects!

*Happy coding!*
